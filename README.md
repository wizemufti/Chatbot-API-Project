# Chatbot-API-Project
Created a chatroom with API calls strictly using Java &amp; Javascript on Eclipse (PircBot).  
Demonstrated the uses of multiple API's. 
Each API has it's own separate file with the chatbot being in it's own file as-well. 

Current API's on the project include 
- Weather city & zipcode API
- Need Advice API

Other functions in the project include 
- help
- time. 

More API's and functions will be added to this project overtime.  
Each function used JSON and was parsed through GSON to get rid of unnecessary information / data. 
For example, parsing removes the author's name, quotation marks, brackets, references, etc. and only outputs the required 
information to the user from the from the program through the chatbot

To use the chatbot, the host must have the chatbot online.
